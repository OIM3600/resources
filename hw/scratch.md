# Scratch Homework

It's time for an exciting adventure, whether you embark on it as a group or individually! Your task is straightforward: create a project of your choice using Scratch, available at [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/). This project can take the form of an interactive story, game, animation, or any other creative endeavor, with the only stipulation being that it must adhere to the following requirements:

- Your project must incorporate at least two sprites, and one of them should not be a cat.
- Your project should include a minimum of three scripts in total (not necessarily three per sprite).
- tilize at least one conditional statement, one loop, and one variable in your project.
- Design and employ at least one custom block that you create yourself using the "**Make a Block**" feature, which must accept at least one input.
- Your project should be more intricate and elaborate than the examples demonstrated in our lectures.
  
To fulfill these requirements, your group's project will likely involve dozens of puzzle pieces in total. It's important that your code is not only accurate but also well-structured. If one of your scripts becomes excessively long, consider breaking it into smaller scripts, each with a specific function. Additionally, explore the concept of "abstraction" where applicable; if you can envision assigning a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g., "meow"), these could potentially be encapsulated within a custom block!

To aid in your creative journey, you can refer to these helpful [tutorials](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all) or explore [starter projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/starter-projects). While you're encouraged to seek inspiration on scratch.mit.edu, brainstorm ideas as a group and work collaboratively to bring them to life. However, refrain from attempting to implement your entire project all at once. Instead, break it down into manageable steps. In essence, take small strides: write a bit of code (drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test it, then write more, test again, and continue this iterative process. Be sure to save your work regularly by selecting "**File > Save**" to prevent any loss of progress.

If, at any point, you encounter challenges in implementing certain features, don't be discouraged; consider adjusting your design or finding creative workarounds. If you pursue an idea that excites you, chances are you'll find it enjoyable to meet the above requirements.

Now, let the adventure begin! Whether you choose to collaborate as a group or work individually, make us proud!

Upon completion of your project, take one final step: select "**File > Save**" to preserve your work. Then, choose "**File > Save to your computer**" and keep that file for submission. If your computer prompts you to "**Open**" or "**Save**" the file, ensure you select "**Save**."

## When you finish:

Upon completion of your project, take one final step: select "File > Save" to preserve your work. Then, choose "File > Save to your computer" and keep that file for submission. If your computer prompts you to "Open" or "Save" the file, ensure you select "Save." Submit the .sb3 file on Canvas.
